# tcpdump analysis

ðŸ”” *Note:* This project was made in the Spring Semester 2024 by Joshua Fouch, the code was copied from my school git repository to add into my main GitHub account!

## Description
This is a perl project displaying the use of hashes, arrays, regular expressions, and tcpdump analyzing in perl scripting! Each file has a specific purpose and usage which will be laid out in this README file as well as in more detail in the comments of each perl script.

## Scripts Overview

### bigpac.pl
- **Purpose**: 
    - Analyzes packets *exceeding* specific lengths in tcpdump files by comparing the packet lengths against the what the user inputs. 
    - This can analyze both IP4 and IP6 addresses.

- **Usage**: 
``` bash
perl bigpac.pl [-t4 OR -t6] -l <length> input_file
# example: perl bigpac.pl -t4 -l 500 ai_tcpdump.txt
```
### iphist.pl
- **Purpose**:
    - Generates a histogram (of '#') of distinct IP addresses (-c)
    - OR can calculate the average packet size for each IP address (-s)
- **Usage**:
``` bash
perl iphist.pl [-c|-s] input_file
# Example: perl iphist.pl -c ai_tcpdump.txt
```
### porthist.pl
- **Purpose**:
    - Same idea as iphist but with ports
    - Generates a histogram of distinct ports (-c)
    - OR calculate the average packet size for each port (-s)
- **Usage**:
``` bash
perl porthist.pl [-c|-s] input_file
# Example: perl porthist.pl -s ai_tcpdump.txt
```
### timehist.pl
- **Purpose**: 
    - Generates frequency of distinct IP addresses in a given time period (-c)
    - Calculates the average packet size for each IP address in a given time period (-s)
- **Usage**:
``` bash
perl timehist.pl [-c|-s] -n <hours> input_file
# Example: perl timehist.pl -c -n 24 ai_tcpdump.tx
```

## Test Data

### ai_tcpdump.txt
- This is an AI generated tcpdump log file which simulates network traffic patterns that would be generated by an actual tcpdump file.
- contains IP4 and IP6 addresses
- contains various ports and protocols
- different packet sizes
- timestamps

## Requirements
- needs at least perl 5.x
- Can be used on pwsh
- Or Unix-system with bash or zsh, or similar

## Installation
1. Install perl
2. git clone repo
3. cd into repo
4. run the usages as above
